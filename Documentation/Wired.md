*How to build a cheap **Hotdog**.*

<br>

If you have access to a 3D printer and use a cheap  
Nano clone with `CH340`, the whole thing will run  
you around `$20`, not counting the sleeve itself.

<br>

## Parts

-   Transparent Sleeve

    *I use **[This][Sleeve]** one.*

-   3D Printed

    - **[Bottom Casing]**
    - **[Top Casing]**
    
    <br>
    
-   Arduino Nano

-   2 x Single row 15 pin female header

-   2 x Universal PCB 

    `50mm x 100mm`
    
    Such as:
    
    - **[Amazon][PCB Amazon]**
    - **[Hestore][PCB Hestore]**
    - **[Ormix][PCB Ormix]**
    
    <br>
    
-   5 x `GL5528` Photoresistor

-   3 x `334-15/T1C1-4WYA` LEDs 
    
    *These are actually overkill, you could also*  
    *go with dimmer LEDs and a smaller resistor*
    
-   `1kΩ` resistor

-   Long USB cable 

    *For the Arduino Nano*

-   Mini zip ties

    *Less than `3mm` in width*
    
-   Rubber bands

-   Solder and hook-up wire

## Programming

Upload the **[Firmware]** to the micro-controller.

*Check out the **[Guide]** if you have never done this.*

## Assembly

1.  Place the photo-resistors on the **back side** of the  
    PCB at equal distances along the middle line.

    The exact distance between them is not that  
    important, but try to place them evenly.
    
    Solder them in position.
    
    *This is easier if your PCB is plated on both sides, if it  
    isn't, then take extra care not to burn the photocells.*

    <img
      src = '../Resources/Wired/photo1.jpg'
      height = 300
    />
    
    <br>

2.  Wire up the photocells as shown diagram, except  
    with the wires on the **front side** of the board.
    
    <img
      src = '../Resources/Wired/Schematics/A.svg'
      width = 400
    />

    The front side should look something like this:
    
    <img
      src = '../Resources/Wired/photo2.jpg'
      height = 300
    />
    
    <br>

3.  Put the sockets on the Nano and solder them  
    onto the board in the below orientation.

    *Leave at least one row space at the top ↓*

    <img
      src = '../Resources/Wired/photo3.jpg'
      height = 300
    />

    You don't have to solder each and every pin  
    in, but at the bare minimum, do the corners.
    
    Make sure you don't solder any adjacent pins together.
    
    <br>

4.  Now connect the photocells to the  
    Nano according to the diagram.

    ***Do NOT solder the wires directly onto***  
    ***the Nano, solder them to the sockets.***
    
    *I couldn't find a way to illustrate this in*  
    *Fritzing, so also see the photo for reference.*

    <img
      src = '../Resources/Wired/Schematics/B.svg'
      height = 220
    />
    <img
      src = '../Resources/Wired/photo4.jpg'
      height = 220
    />

    After the photocells are connected, you can trim off all the legs.
    
    <br>

5.  Mount the LEDs on the second PCB and  
hook them up to the Nano to each other.
    
    *Black wire to cathodes.*

    Don't forget the resistor.
    
    <img
      src = '../Resources/Wired/Schematics/C.svg'
      height = 360
    />
    <img
      src = '../Resources/Wired/photo5.jpg'
      height = 360
    />

    <br>

6.  Tie the casings together at the back with zip-ties.

    Leave them loose and don't tighten them until the sleeve is in.

    <img
      src = '../Resources/Wired/photo6.jpg'
      height = 300
    />

    <br>

7.  Slide the PCBs in, secure each with a zip-tie  
    and the clipped off end of another zip-tie.
    
    <img
      src = '../Resources/Wired/photo7.jpg'
      width = 470
    />
    
    <br>

8.  Add the sleeve, hold it down with rubber bands  
    at the front and tighten the zip-ties at the back.

    *Make sure all sides of the casing press down on the sleeve evenly.*

    <img
      src = '../Resources/Wired/photo8.jpg'
      width = 470
    />

    <br>

9.  Serve hot.
